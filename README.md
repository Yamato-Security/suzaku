# About Suzaku

Suzaku (朱雀) means "Vermilion Bird" who is a god who flies above the clouds ruling over the southern heavens in Chinese mythology.

Suzaku is going to be a threat hunting and fast forensics timeline generator for cloud logs.
(Imagine [Hayabusa](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa) but for cloud logs instead of Windows event logs.)
It is currently under development and we will first support AWS and then Azure logs.
